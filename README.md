# Statistical Analysis of Hydrometeorological Variables

***Work in Progress!***

This repository contains support scripts for statistical analysis of hydrometeorological variables. Initially intended for teaching in the courses of Applied stochastic processes, Hydroclimatolgy,  Variabilidad Clim√°tica and Climate Variability at Javeriana University.

Here you will find scripts for:

 ## 1. [Randomness analysis](https://github.com/mathmodelling/fuzzy-journey/blob/main/randomness.md)
 ## 2. Gap filling
 ## 3. Fitting theoretical probability density curves
 ## 4. Calculation of statistical moments
 ## 5. Hydrometeorological Teleconnections
 ## 6. Secular cycles
 ## 7. Spatial interpolation
 ## 8. Water balance
 
 ## Disclaimer

All scripts were developed to work in a chain starting from raw data and finishing with a gauged territory's water balance. All scripts are provided as is; use them under your own responsibility.
