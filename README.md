# Statistical Analysis of Hydrometeorological Variables

***Work in Progress!***

This repository contains support scripts for statistical analysis of hydrometeorological variables. Initially intended for teaching in the courses of Applied stochastic processes, Hydroclimatolgy,  Hydroclimatology and Climate Variability at Javeriana University.

Here you will find scripts for:

 ## [Randomness analysis](https://github.com/mathmodelling/fuzzy-journey/blob/main/randomness.md)
 ## Gap filling
 ## Fitting theoretical probability density curves
 ## Calculation of statistical moments
 ## Hydrometeorological Teleconnections
 ## Secular cycles
 ## Spatial interpolation
 ## Water balance
 
 ## References

All scripts were developed to work in a chain starting from raw data and finishing with a gauged territory's water balance. All scripts are provided as is; use them under your own responsibility.
